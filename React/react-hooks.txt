    what is react hooks ?
        these are new feat added to react to amke the functional components stateful 
        it allow to use react feat without writting a class 
        hooks only works inside a functions

    why hooks ?
        to reduce the reliance on this keywords

        to handle sideeffects => useEffect hook will run on component mount,component unmount and component update so this single hook does the job of the 3 lifecyle methods (componentDidUpdate,compoentDidMount,componentWillUnmount)
        
        makes the code cleaner and more managable

        reuse logic easily 

        easier to test

    Rules for Hooks 
        
        dont call hooks inside loops , conditions and in the nested functions 
        always call hooks from react functional component and not just regular functions in js 
        only call hooks at the top level
