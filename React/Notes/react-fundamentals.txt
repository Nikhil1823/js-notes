    diff types of compoennts in react ?
        1.stateless functional compoennts
            these are just js function sthat returns jsx 

        2.stateful class compoennts
            A stateful class component is a component that:

            Is written as a class

            Extends React.Component

            Has its own internal state

            Can use lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.


        func comp vs class comp
            functional 
                -> simple 
                use func compoennts as much as possible 
                absence of this keyword
                functional compoentns are also stateful with the help of react hooks
                mainly reposible for using
                dumb/presentational

            class
                more feature rich
                maintain their own state-private data
                complex ui logic
                provide lifecyle hook

    types of export in jsx ?

        export default or the defult export => here we can  this function with any name we wanted there is no issue there

        named export => export cont greet=()=>return <h1>Hi</hi>
        in named exports we just exactly specify the name of the component


    notes : modul.exports={} is available only in common js and es moduole syntax
    and react follows es module syntax
    
    whats is jsx ?
        jsx => javascript xml   

    props vs state

        props: props get passed through attribute of component
        it is a fumction parameters 
        props are immutable
        inside function props are accesible by props.nameor props.valeu or so
        inside class props are accessible through this.props.valeu



        state : state is managed within the component
            these are variable declared in function body
            state can be changed 

            infunctional component => useState hooks
            in class components we use this.state

    setState in react class component

        inorder to modify teh state of a variable in react we use useState() that help us to modify the state of the varibale and thereby upadting the dom,
        the useState method expect an object to update the state and it callback as second arguemnt (optional) which will be called once the state is updated 
        useState is a async operation  the call back will be called once that dom updation is completed
        setState are async so inorder to call a function or log something after the setState use that callback in the secind arguemnt

        pass to update the state based on the previous valeu pass  a callback instead
        that update the state based on the previus state value.
        it taeks curetn state as argument to the prev state and return an updated object as the resultant
         eg:
             incrementOnClick = () => {
                this.setState((prevState) => {
                return { count: prevState.count + 1 };
                });
            };   

        destructering props is a es6 feature
        in class based component props are destructed inside the render 
        always use arrow function inside class component to handle the 'this' keyword issue

        passing a method as a props to the child component from tha parent component

            we can pass the methods of the parent component to tha child as a attrubute to the child .
        conditional rendering in react
            4 diff methods are available

                1.if else statements 
                    return multiple jsx files based on diff condition 
                
                2.terinary operator 
                    you know what it Is

                3.element varibales
                    stores the content on a variable and updatung that variable conditionally

                4.short circuting  operator
                    syntax:

                        condition && TheTHingWeWantToReturn
        keys in react elements 

            in react key property of an element are used  to identify the list element  uniquely by react . it help react to find out which elements are changed and which one needs to be changed 
            when are the paced where we can use index as the list key 
                when we list item wont change 
                when the items in our list dont have a uniwue id 
                when we dont reorder or filters the list
        how to apply style sheets to a react component ?

            we can add it at the top of the component and just add the class names to the components like we do normally in html and css 
        diff methods to apply a css stylesheets

            1.inline
            2.adding a seperate css module (local scoped)
                it have compoent level scope and wont afect css class name conflict
                it just like creatinf each css files for each  component and appendinf them to each of the components


            3.regular css (global scoped )
                create a plain css file and import it globally and it will afect the compoennts and elements based on the our style rules
                it like writting the css classes in the global style sheet index.css


        in react
            re-render happens only if the state of any of the components chanegs or its props changes
        lifecycle methods of class componensts in react 
            there are mainly four lifecylce methods in class components they are

                1.mounting
                    called when an instance of a compomemt is being created and inserted into the dom

                2.upadting
                    called when a component is being re rendered as result of chnege either its prop or state

                3.unmounting

                4.error handling
