  
    what is ts?
         it is a typed superset of js . and it it developed and maintained by microsoft
         the ts is complied to js and run using a js engine      
          

how to run a ts file ?
    ts is converted into js before executing it 

    create a ts file and run the commands 
        tsc fileName --watch 
        this will create a corresponding js file to our ts 
        then the js file using browser or node 
    

    In ts there is only global scope and function scope and not block scope 
    that is

    unknown is a type-safe counterpart of any â€” you cannot access properties on it unless you narrow its type.

    !!obj : 	Converts any value to boolean: false for null, undefined, 0, ""; true for others


    ts will try to assign variable type at the time we define the value to it and it is called type inference

    union of type : 
        in ts we can assign a union of types to variable in that case the variable can take any one of the type 
    optional parameter :
        we can make a parameter optional by adding a question mark to it , like this 
        function some(val?:number)


    interfaces in ts : 
            interface in ts i sued to define the shape of an object in ts 

            interface is somehow similar to type 

            interface can combine multiple interface by extends keyword while type can do this by union

                interface Animal {
                    name: string;
                    }

                interface Dog extends Animal {
                    breed: string;
                    }

                type A = { name: string };

                type B = A & { age: number };
            a class can use a interface by using the implements keyword

            class are same as that of js or java 

            access modifier are also the same in java
